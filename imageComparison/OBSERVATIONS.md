# Part 2: Spot the Differences

### Objective:
Identify differences between these two images.

### Task:
List all visual or functional differences that might affect testing outcomes or user experience.
  
### Observations:
Following are my visual observations:
- In "[Image1](/data/images/Image1.jpg)", the “My Accounts” title is bold, while in "[Image2](/data/images/Image2.jpg)", it is regular or thin.
- "[Image2](/data/images/Image2.jpg)" has a missing “c” in the “My Accounts” title.
- "[Image2](/data/images/Image2.jpg)" has a red subtitle “My Acounts,” and this title also has a missing letter “c”.
- The height of the card in both images is different, including the height of the title bar.
- The amount in "[Image1](/data/images/Image1.jpg)" is bold, while in "[Image2](/data/images/Image2.jpg)", it is thin or regular.
- The “Acct #: 123456789” text in "[Image1](/data/images/Image1.jpg)" is centered, while in "[Image2](/data/images/Image2.jpg)", it is aligned to the right.
- In "[Image2](/data/images/Image2.jpg)", the card has three buttons without padding, while in "[Image1](/data/images/Image1.jpg)", it has only one button.
- The color of the buttons is slightly different; "[Image2](/data/images/Image2.jpg)" has lighter blue buttons than "[Image1](/data/images/Image1.jpg)".
